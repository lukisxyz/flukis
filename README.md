I'm a Software Engineer with 2 years experiences in frontend engineering using ReactJS, i also have experiences in IOT related stuff.

My goals in 5 years is knowing how to build digital product end to end either on server, browser, or mobile apps. To achieve that goals, i learn backend engineering using Golang and currently learning Kotlin Jetpack Compose for mobile development purposes.
